API IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: CRITICAL - NO BACKEND FOUND

PROJECT ANALYSIS:
- Frontend-only Next.js application
- Zero API routes implemented
- All data served through mock files
- Database schema v2.7 designed but not implemented

MISSING ENDPOINTS: 45 total
- Authentication: 8 endpoints (0% complete)
- Workflows: 8 endpoints (0% complete)  
- Categories: 5 endpoints (0% complete)
- Comments: 5 endpoints (0% complete)
- Favorites: 3 endpoints (0% complete)
- Purchases: 4 endpoints (0% complete)
- Notifications: 4 endpoints (0% complete)
- Contact: 2 endpoints (0% complete)
- Admin: 6 endpoints (0% complete)

CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
- No database connection
- No authentication system
- No CRUD operations for any table
- No file upload system
- No email system

RECOMMENDED ACTION:
1. Implement FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL
2. Create all 45 required API endpoints
3. Replace mock data with real API calls
4. Deploy backend infrastructure

COMPLETION RATIO: 0/45 endpoints (0%)
STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY
